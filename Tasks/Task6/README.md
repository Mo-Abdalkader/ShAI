# Machine Learning Project Life Cycle

## Introduction

This Folder contains the code and documentation for a machine learning project aimed at predicting housing prices. 
The project follows a structured approach, covering various stages of the machine learning lifecycle.

The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that can accurately estimate the median house value based on several input features. 
To achieve this goal, we follow a systematic process that includes data acquisition, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model training, evaluation, and optimization.

This README provides an overview of the project structure, key steps, and explanations of important tasks performed throughout the project. 
Below is a detailed breakdown of the project components:



### Get the Data
> Importance: This step is crucial as it lays the foundation for the entire machine learning project. Without properly loading and understanding the dataset, it's impossible to proceed with analysis, preprocessing, or modeling. It sets the stage for data exploration, cleaning, and preparation.
- Import necessary libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib.
- Read the housing dataset from a CSV file.
- Display the first few rows of the dataset.
- Display information about the dataset.
- Display summary statistics of the dataset.
- Display value counts for the 'ocean_proximity' column.
- Plot histograms for numerical attributes.

### Create a Test Set
> Importance: Creating a separate test set is essential for evaluating the performance of the trained model. By splitting the dataset into training and testing subsets, you can train the model on one portion and assess its performance on unseen data to gauge its generalization capabilities. This helps to prevent overfitting and provides a more realistic estimate of the model's performance.
- Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
- Calculate the correlation between attributes and the target variable.
- Plot a scatter plot between 'median_house_value' and 'median_income'.
- Plot histograms for the 'median_income' attribute.

### Visualizing the Data
> Importance: Visualization aids in understanding the data's underlying patterns, relationships, and distributions. It helps identify potential correlations between variables, detect outliers, and gain insights into the dataset's characteristics. Visualizations guide feature selection, engineering, and model interpretation, leading to better-informed decisions throughout the project.
- Create a copy of the training set for visualization.
- Plot scatter plots of geographical data ('longitude' vs 'latitude').
- Plot a scatter plot with population size and house values.
- Calculate correlation matrix and sort attributes by correlation with 'median_house_value'.
- Plot scatter matrix for selected attributes.
- Plot a scatter plot between 'median_income' and 'median_house_value'.
- Engineer new attributes: 'rooms_per_household', 'bedroom_per_room', 'population_per_household'.
- Calculate correlation matrix after attribute engineering.

### Data Preparation
> Importance: Data preparation encompasses various tasks such as handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features. This step ensures that the data is in a suitable format for training machine learning models. Properly prepared data improves model performance, reduces biases, and enhances the model's ability to learn relevant patterns.
- Separate predictors and labels from the training set.
- Check for missing values in the test set and drop corresponding rows.
- Encode categorical attribute 'ocean_proximity' using one-hot encoding.
- Transform categorical attributes in the training and test sets.
- Convert encoded categorical attributes to DataFrame and join with original data.
- Drop the 'ocean_proximity' column from the training and test sets.
- Reindex the datasets.

### Training the Model
> Importance: Model training involves fitting the chosen machine learning algorithm to the training data to learn patterns and relationships. This step is central to the project as it defines the model's predictive capabilities. Choosing appropriate algorithms and evaluating their performance on the training data is crucial for building accurate and reliable predictive models.
- Train a Linear Regression model.
- Evaluate Linear Regression model's performance using RMSE.
- Train a Decision Tree Regressor model.
- Evaluate Decision Tree Regressor model's performance using RMSE.
- Perform cross-validation on both models.
- Train a Random Forest Regressor model.
- Evaluate Random Forest Regressor model's performance using RMSE.
- Inspect dataset information.

### Hyperparameter Tuning
> Importance: Hyperparameter tuning optimizes the model's performance by searching for the best combination of hyperparameters. Fine-tuning hyperparameters improves the model's predictive accuracy and generalization capabilities. It helps prevent overfitting and ensures that the model is robust across different datasets.
- Perform Grid Search CV to find the best hyperparameters for Random Forest Regressor.
- Display the best hyperparameters.
- Perform Grid Search CV for hyperparameter tuning.
- Display the best hyperparameters from grid search.

### Feature Importance
> Importance: Understanding feature importance helps identify which features have the most significant impact on the model's predictions. This knowledge is valuable for feature selection, identifying key drivers of the target variable, and explaining the model's behavior to stakeholders. Feature importance analysis guides feature engineering efforts and provides insights into the underlying problem domain.
- Calculate feature importances from the best models.
- Display feature importances sorted by importance.

### Evaluation
> Importance: Evaluating the model's performance on unseen test data provides an unbiased estimate of its predictive accuracy. It validates the model's generalization ability and assesses its suitability for deployment in real-world scenarios. Model evaluation ensures that the developed solution meets the desired performance criteria and can be trusted for making predictions on new data.
- Prepare test data for evaluation.
- Evaluate the final model's performance on the test set using RMSE.
